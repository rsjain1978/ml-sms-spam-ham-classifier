- sms-spam-ham-svm-classifier.py
 - main python file which when executed presents console based options to either: view the distribution of classes (option 1), or run the classifier using k-folds (option 3) or run the classifier using hold out (option 4).

- spam.csv
 - csv file which has the dataset which needs to be classified.

- model performance
 - With cross validation we see that the model average score is 1

- Todo
code currently is unable to predict the most frequent used words in the dataset (option 2 in the console options)
